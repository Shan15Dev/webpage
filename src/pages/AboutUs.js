        <p>
          My Nickname is Shan and I'm a computer scientist apprentice in my first out of four yerars.
          I'm a fan of technology since I was a small child because of that I decided to that apprenticeship.
          Currently I'm learning Java (Gradle, Spring (Backend), JavaFX) and ReactJS.
          Next Year I'm going to learn DOTNET.
